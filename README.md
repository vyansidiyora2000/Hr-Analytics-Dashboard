**Project Overview**

This project utilized four essential data analysis tools: Power BI, Tableau Desktop, SQL, and Excel.

**Data**

HR Data 2022 of a medical components manufacturing company (open source)

**Problem Statement**

Within the organization, the HR department bears the responsibility of monitoring and overseeing diverse facets of employee data to ensure the maintenance of a healthy workforce. Nevertheless, a notable deficiency exists in terms of well-defined performance indicators to systematically track and analyze critical HR metrics.
To address this challenge, the project was structured around several pivotal components, meticulously designed to offer invaluable insights and hands-on experience.

**Analysis**

A set of KPIs that can greatly benefit the HR department has been designed to address the following points:

**_Employee Count:_**
With this KPI in place, the HR department can gain clear visibility into the total number of employees. This would enable effective workforce assessment, aiding in future growth or downsizing planning.

**_Attrition Count:_**
By implementing a standardized method for tracking employee attrition, the HR department can obtain reliable and comprehensive data on the number of employees who have left the organization.

**_Attrition Rate:_**
The introduction of a clear measure for attrition rate offers the opportunity to assess turnover levels. This can be instrumental in comparing these rates with industry benchmarks and gaining insights into employee satisfaction and engagement levels.

**_Active Employees:_**
The ability to differentiate between active and inactive employees provides the HR department with a valuable tool to assess workforce productivity and capacity accurately.

**_Average Age:_**
By incorporating the average age KPI, the HR department can delve into workforce demographics. This insight can inform effective succession planning and enhance the organization's ability to attract and retain younger talent.

The HR department's challenges in understanding attrition patterns based on gender, department-wise attrition rates, employee age distribution, job satisfaction ratings, education field-wise attrition, and attrition rates by gender for different age groups have all been successfully addressed through visualizations:

**_Attrition by Gender:_**
Insightful visualizations that enable a comprehensive understanding of attrition patterns based on gender. This newfound clarity aids in identifying any gender-related disparities and facilitates the implementation of targeted retention strategies.

**_Department-wise Attrition:_**
Visualizations have been deployed to showcase attrition rates across different departments. This enhancement empowers the HR department to easily identify departments with higher attrition rates, allowing them to promptly address any underlying issues or concerns.

**_Number of Employees by Age Group:_**
Visual representations have been established to analyze the distribution of employees across various age groups. This data supports the assessment of workforce demographics and facilitates the identification of age-related gaps or imbalances, informing the implementation of targeted HR policies or programs.


The HR department can benefit from visualizations representing job satisfaction ratings, providing an effective means to measure employee engagement and overall job satisfaction levels.

**_Education Field-wise Attrition:_**
Visual representations have been implemented to analyze attrition rates based on education fields. This allows for the identification of specific educational backgrounds associated with higher attrition, enabling tailored retention strategies.
**
_Attrition Rate by Gender for Different Age Groups:_**
Visualizations display attrition rates based on gender and different age groups. This enables the HR department to identify age and gender-related attrition trends, facilitating the implementation of targeted retention strategies for specific employee segments.
